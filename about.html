			<h1>ABOUT MYSELF</h1>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Hi, I'm Kim Charlene Lozano, will become 21 years old this coming October 16, 2020 and currently 2nd Year student in Cainta Catholic College. I have a Big Brother he is John Kent Lozano and he's in Bicol now because he has a work there and our house are in Bicol. The saddest part of my life is when my mother died the day after my 18<sup>th</sup> birthday. The cause of my mother's death is due to cardiac arrest and maybe because of fatigue because shes working and the same time working as our mother. Im Second Year College Students taking up Bacherlor of Science Major in Computer Science. I follow my brother because He take also the course Computer Science in the past but now he's taking Information Technology in Bicol and somtimes I ask my Brother to help me to improve my codind skills. My hobby are dancing, singing, playing online game and surfing on social media. That is my everyday life, playing games, doing some assignments and activity and listening to music are like mt healing time to myself. Im into K-pop now like Blackpink, Mamamoo and Red velvet. Im still into Rock genre also like my favorite band Paramore, Sleeping with Sirens, All TIme Low and Pierce the Veil. Listening to music is like my other world, it  drives me somewhere where Im alone and just listening to their song where no one will bother me and it heals my chaotic mind when Im stress. What will I do when I finish my study?, I will find a good job and make more money to help my Brother and my other relative who are with us when my mother died and I will go to the country where I want to go. I will like to eat their food because I love eating and I'd like to taste it all. To all the people who help me I will repay them to all the things they've done to us because that is the only thing we can do with them and I'm thankful for them because they treat us like a real family and were not feel outcast from them.</p>

			<h2>2009</h2>
			<p>Blackpink began forming when YG Entertainment held tryouts worldwide for preteen or teenage recruits to create a new girl group after launching its first major girl group, 2NE1, in 2009. According to the members, joining the label as trainees was similar to enrolling in a full-time pop-star academy, with Jennie describing the experience as "more strict than school" and Rosé comparing it to The X Factor with dorm rooms. For members who had left their lives outside of South Korea, the pace of training alongside the culture shock was especially difficult. Preparations for Blackpink's debut began as early as 2011, when YG Entertainment revealed on November 14 that their new girl group would debut in the early half of 2012 and feature at least seven members. Since then, numerous news and rumors surfaced surrounding the new girl group's debut being delayed, although there had been no official information. It was only until May 18, 2016 that YG Entertainment confirmed the girl group would debut that July, stating that the members were selected through years of stiff competition. The label later confirmed that Jang Hanna and Moon Sua, who were introduced to the public as potential members of the new girl group, were not included in the lineup.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>2010</h2>
			<p>Jennie was the first group member revealed, on June 1. She joined YG Entertainment as a trainee in 2010 after moving back to South Korea from New Zealand. She had been introduced to the public for the first time in 2012 in a photo titled "Who's that girl?" on YG Entertainment's website on April 10. Jennie continued to be promoted as a member of the new girl group through multiple collaborations: she starred in G-Dragon's 2012 music video for "That XX" from his One of a Kind EP and featured in the song "Black" from his 2013 album Coup d'etat (2013) and Lee Hi's song "Special" from her album First Love (2013).</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>July 2011</h2>
			<p>On June 15, Jisoo was revealed to be the new group's third member. She joined YG Entertainment as a trainee in July 2011 and appeared in several advertisements and music videos in her pre-debut years, including "Spoiler + Happy Ending" (2014) from Epik High's studio album Shoebox and Hi Suhyun's music video "I'm Different" (2014). She also made a cameo appearance in 2015 drama The Producers.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>2012: WHO'S THAT GIRL???</h2>
			<p>Rosé was the final member to be revealed, on June 22, 2016. She ranked first among 700 applicants in the 2012 YG Entertainment audition in Australia, after which she signed a trainee contract with the label and moved to Seoul to begin training. She featured in G-Dragon's track "Without You" (2012) from One of a Kind, credited as "? from YG New Girl Group" until her official public introduction.</p>
			<br>
			<p>May 11th, a video was uploaded on YGE’s Youtube channel focusing on a trainee dancing to  Chris Brown’s “Turn Up The Music”. Netizens were quick to recognize the featured trainee as Lalisa ‘Lalice’ Manoban or Lisa who came from Thailand. Lisa was revealed as the new girl group's second member on June 8, 2016. She was the only individual among 4,000 applicants to pass the 2010 YG Entertainment audition in her native Thailand and became the label's first foreign trainee in 2011. She was first introduced in 2012 in a video that was posted on YG Entertainment's YouTube channel, titled "Who's That Girl???". Lisa also appeared in the music video for Taeyang's "Ringa Linga" in 2013. She became a spokesperson for street-wear brand Nona9on in 2015 and cosmetics brand Moonshot in 2016.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>2013: YG NEW ARTIST</h2>
			<p>YG started 2013 by naming Mystery Girl #2 from the black and white teaser photo as Kim Jisoo. The agency revealed her as the second official member of the upcoming girl group along with 2 new photos. A few days after, a new practice video of Jennie Kim was unveiled to the public. In the video, Jennie is seen sing-rapping to Lotus Flower Bomb by Wale feat. Miguel. Moreover, Jennie was featured on “Special”, a track from Lee Hi’s first full-length album. Though the girls were supposed to debut early that year, YG later announced another postponement through “FROM YG” on June 19. He said that they are planning to debut the girls on October 2013 with the remaining 6 members adopting an unconventional debut promotion. He further disclosed that the members are multilingual who are fluent in Korean, English and Japanese. Regardless of the delay that year, the revealed members were still seen on some of YG artists’ projects. We’ve also gotten a glimpse of Lisa on Taeyang’s “Ringa Linga” music video dancing in the background with brother groups, Winner and iKON. In that brief appearance, Lisa gave out a confident and free spirited impression.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>2014: PRODUCT MODEL AND LISA AND MV ACTRESS JISOO</h2>
			<p>It was in 2014 when we first saw Lisa as a product endorser when she joined iKON’s B.I. and Bobby in modelling for YG’s clothing line, Nonagon/Nona9on. In addition that year, Jisoo took part in Epik High’s “Spoiler” + “Happen Ending” music video and acted as a couple with iKON’s Bobby on HISUHYUN’s “I’m Different” music video. It was also revealed then that Kpopstar contestant, Jang Hanna, joined YG with the possibility of her joining the new girl group which was reportedly to be making a debut on November 2014. Sadly, Kim Eunbi withdraws from the group due to health reasons.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>2015: CF PRINCESS JISOO</h2>
			<p>Jisoo has landed 4 endorsements that year! She had promotional shoots and commercial filmings for various products and services namely, Samsonite Red, Nikon, AngelStone, Smart Uniform. She even had the opportunity to be on print and tv with Hallyu star Lee Minho and labelmate group, iKON. Jisoo has also cameo-ed with YG Fam actors, Kang Seungyoon and Sandara Park on KBS’ drama, “The Producers”, as fictional regular casts of KBS’ variety show, “2 Days, 1 Night”.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>2016: JENNIE, JISOO, LISA & ROSÉ ARE BLACKPINK</h2>
			<p>As soon as the summer heat of 2016 was felt, YG once again hyped fans by announcing that the new girl group is finally going to debut on July with Teddy, YG’s resident producer, leading the production of the girls’ debut repertoire. It was also reported that international choreographers and high-quality directors were involved in the upcoming girl group’s debut preparation and promotion. The members of the group is said to be revealed one by one every week starting on June 1. Jennie was first and YG posted 7 photos of her, each conveying different concepts and expressions. Next was Lisa with photos highlighting her slender body and long legs. On June 15, it was Jisoo’s turn exuding with sweet and innocent aura. Last but certainly not the least, Rosé’s photo teasers were unveiled along with the information that she’s a Korean who was born and raised in Australia. YG also confirmed that she was the featured singer on G-Dragon’s 2012 track, “”결국” (In The End/Without You). A week following that, on June 29th, YG revealed that the group is complete and is named “BLACKPINK”, a name to mean that the group is not just pretty visuals but also talented individuals. It was further explained that while “PINK” is described to be feminine and pretty, the group’s visual is not only what they have to offer as the “BLACK” at the front of their name symbolizes a premium meaning like that of specially labelled products suggesting the members are talented as well. Ahead of the debut, YGE posted onto BLACKPINK’s official Youtube channel a dance practice video of the group covering Parris Geobel & The Royal Family’s choreography to Rihanna’s “B**** Better Have My Money”. Furthermore, BLACKPINK opened their official Instagram account and Facebook page. On the 29th of July, YG announced their debut date to be 888, August 8th at 8PM KST along with a teaser photo followed by reports that BLACKPINK has completed filming 3 music videos and that Teddy already finished the upcoming girl group’s debut album after 2 years of preparation.

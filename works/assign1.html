<h1> The Story in the book </h1>
<h2> Chapter 1 </h2>
<p> Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i> Nature, New Scientist, </i> and all the other scienetific journals her work had appeard in, was a well
thumbed copy of <cite> On the Road </cite>. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
<br>
<br>
She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do.</q> Although many considered her
pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the Ilama <abbr title="dna">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em> did </em> think she had something better to do. </p>

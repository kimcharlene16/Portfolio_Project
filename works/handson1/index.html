		<p> The <b>orange</b> is the fruit of the citrus species <i> Citrus × sinesis</i> in the family Rutaceae.<sup>[1]</sup>It is also called <b>sweet orange,</b> to distinguish it from the related <i>Citrus × aurantium,</i> referred to as bitter orange. The sweet
		orange produces asexually (apomixis through nucellar embryony); varieties of sweet orange arise through mutations.<sup>[2]</sup> <br>
		<br>
		The orange is hybrid between pomelo <i>(Citrus maxima)</i> and mandarin <i>(Citrus reticulata).</i> It has genes that are ~25% pomelo and ~75% mandarin;<sup>[2][3]</sup> however, it is not a simple backcrossed BC1 hybrid, but
		hybridized over multiple generations.<sup>[4]</sup> The chloroplast genes, and therefore the maternal line, seem to be pomelo.<sup>[2]</sup> The sweet orange has had its full genome sequenced.<sup>[2]</sup> Earlier estimates of the percentage
		of pomelo genes varying from ~50% to ~6% have been reported.<sup>[3]</sup> <br>
		<br>
		Sweet oranges were mentioned in Chinese literature in 314 BC.<sup>[2]</sup> As of 1987, orange trees were found to be most cultivated fruit tree in the world.<sup>[5]</sup> Orange tree are widely grown in tropical and
		subtropical climates for their sweet fruit. The fruit of the orange tree can be eaten fresh, or processed for its juice or fragrant peel.<sup>[6]</sup> As of 2012, sweet oranges accounted for a approximately 70% of citrus
		production.<sup>[7]</sup> </p>

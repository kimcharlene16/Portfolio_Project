		Common oranges (also called "white", "round", or "blond" oranges) contitute about two-thirds of all the orange production. The majority of this crop is used
		mostly for juice extraction.<sup>[16][18]</sup>
		<h3> Valencia </h3>
		The Valencia orange is a late-season fruit, and therefore a popular variety when navel oranges are out of season. This is why an anthropomorphic orange was
		chosen as the for the 1982 FIFA World Cup, held in Spain. The mascot was named Naranjito ("little orange") and wore the colors of the Spanish national football
		team.
		<h4> Hart's Tardiff Valencia </h4>
		<i> Thomas Rivers, </i> an English nurseryman, imported this variety from the Azores Islands and catalogued it in 1865 under the Excelsior. Around 1870, he provided trees to S. B. Parsons, a Long Island
		nurseryman, who in turn sold them to E. H. Hart of Federal Point, Florida.<sup>[35]</sup>
		<h4> Hamlin </h4>
		This cultivar was discovered by A. G. Hamlin near Glenwood, Florida, in 1879. The fruit is small, smooth, not highly colored, and juicy, with a pale yellow colored juice, especially in fruits that come from
		lemon rootstock. The fruit may be seedless, or may contain a number of small seeds. The tree is high-yielding and cold-tolerant and it produces good quality fruit, which is harvested from October to December.
		It thrives in humid subtropical climates. In cooler, more arid areas, the trees produce edible fruit, but too small for commercial use.<sup>[12]</sup> </p>
